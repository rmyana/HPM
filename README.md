1. Prepare GIS data and refined Zoning Ordinances.
  a. GIS data
    i. Vacant parcels with zoning codes and land use codes (Assessor's data)
    ii. Remove public/local government owned parcels.
    iii. Remove Open Space parcels.
    iv. Remove approved parcels.
    v. Flood Zones (FEMA flood zones and supplementary flood zones)
    vi. Wetlands
  b. Refined Zoning Ordinances (Zoning Code, Uses, Minimum Required Area, Minimum Development
      Area, Maximum Density, Maximum Lot Coverage, and Future Land Use)
2. Remove vacant parcels that fall into the flood zones and wetlands.
3. Set maximum density using Future Land Use Map.
4. Calculate potential housing units for each parcel.
  a. Define proportions of each housing type, including the proportion for site constraints area, by each
  zoning district. (The proportions are based on ACS statistics data.)
  b. Define Minimum Required Area for each housing type by each zoning district.
  c. Set Maximum Lot Coverage and Maximum Density for each housing type by each zoning district.
    i. If there is maximum density regulation for zoning district, the model compares the
    maximum density for FLUM and zoning district and choose whichever is smaller.
  d. Exclude commercial area for applicable zoning districts.
  e. Outcome: The number of housing units for each housing type by each zoning district.
5. Apply subdivisions (lot size).
  a. Set the proportion for site constraints area either 10% or 40% based on the parcel size.
  (10%: between 1 acre and 15 acres, 40%: greater than 15 acres)
  b. Calculate Single Family housing units for Minor and Major Developments.
  (Minor: smaller than or equal to 10 lots, Major: greater than 10 lots)
